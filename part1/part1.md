2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. Error, result is only accessible in if block
5. Error, we are trying to reassign const variable
6. Error, we are trying to reassign const variable

## Part 1b

1. it will print out what index var i ended at which is the length of prices[] array which is 3.
2. It will print out discountedPrice which is 150.
3. It will print out finalPrice which is 150.
4. It will return the discounted array which is just [50,100,150]
5. Error, i will only be accessible in the for loop block
6. Error, discountedPrice is only accessible in the for loop block
7. It will print 150
8. It will just return the discounted array which will be [50,100,150]
9. Error, i is only accessible in the for loop block
10. It will print out the length of prices which is 3.
11. It will just return the discounted array which is [50,100,150].

    1.  a) student.name
    2.  b) student['Grad Year']
    3.  c) student.greeting()
    4.  d) student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    5.  e) student.courseLoad[0]
13. 
    1.  a) 32, this is because we started the function witha  string which will just concatenate other inputs as a string type, it type converts both into strings
    2.  b) 1, This is because the minus sign operator does a type conversion to make both inputs into integers
    3.  c) 3, null is just converted to 0
    4.  d) 3null , null is just converted to a string
    5.  e) 4, true is given a 1 value for boolean comparisons but is converted to int
    6.  f) 0, false and null are converted to integers
    7.  g) 3undefined, this is because both are converted to string types
    8.  h) NaN because both are converted to int types but undefined is undefined
14. 14
    1.  a) true, both are converted to int types
    2.  b) false, because 2 is lexicographically larger than 12 as a string type
    3.  c) true, both are converted to int types and then are equal
    4.  d) false, both are different types
    5.  e) false, true is equivalent to 1 not 2
    6.  f) true, 2 is converted to a boolean and outputs to true because 2 is not 0 which would be false in the boolean function.
15. The difference between the == and === operators are that the == operator simply checks if two values are equal to eachother without type checking them, this can be used to compare two values of different types and they could still be equivalent. However, the === is a strict equality operator meaning that it checks types between values and they have to be of the same type to possibly return true and it leaves less room for errors when checking equality between values.

17. The result will return newArr which holds [2,4,6]. This is because modifyArray uses doSomething as a callback function for each input and multiplies it by 2.
